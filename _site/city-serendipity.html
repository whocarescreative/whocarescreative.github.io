<h1>City Serendipity</h1>

<p>Recently, I had the chance to spend a week in New York. 
[]</p>

<p>Before leaving my temporary home during my my first day in the Big Apple, I spent at least an hour looking through Google Maps trying to find the place to eat at.</p>

<p>In a city where you can find anything and everything at any given moment, I only considered places that have the largest amount of five star ratings on an application. This distillation is unfair to New York. With that realization, I stepped out of my place, and began to walk around. I would let my eyes and my nose lead the way.</p>

<p>I ended up enjoying a nice bowl of Ramen five blocks [away]. When I looked at the place on Google Maps after, it was rated a lowly 3.9 starts. No way would it have made it through my personal filter if I found the place through the application.</p>

<p>I let this chance encounter guide my attitude toward the rest of trip.</p>

<p>The following days, I would walk until I got hungry. Then, I would come across a food truck, a hole in the wall, or a nice restaurant to refuel at.</p>

<p>Safe to say, this was a freeing feeling. I was never in a hurry. I didn’t have an itinerary. At most, my checklist was one item long. Wednesday was dedicated to Central Park. Thursday was dedicated to exploring around and inside the New York Public Library. On my way to the library, I discovered the Empire State building, like Columbus discovered America. [What a pleasant surprise.]</p>

<p>Upon returning to Calgary, I didn’t feel like I needed a vacation from my vacation. I was happy with the pace of my trip, because I let go of the idea that a trip to a new city should be stressful and planned to the minute.</p>

<p>You might share a similar opinion of travel. But if you don’t, let me introduce you to the idea of travel as a creative act.</p>

<p>Travel, in my opinion, should be about improvisation. Art, almost.</p>

<p>Plan less.</p>
