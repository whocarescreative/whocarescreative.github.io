<h1>City Serendipity</h1>
<h3 class="mb-5">A different way to travel</h3>

<p>Recently, I had the chance to spend a week in New York.
[]</p>

<p>Before leaving my temporary home during my my first day in the Big Apple, I spent at least an hour looking through Google Maps trying to find the place to eat at. [need to speak about a time where i was busy]</p>

<p>In a city where you can find anything and everything at any given moment, I only considered places that have the largest amount of five star ratings on an application. This distillation is unfair to New York. With that realization, I stepped out of my place, and began to walk around. I would let my eyes and my nose lead the way.</p>

<p>I ended up enjoying a nice bowl of Ramen five blocks away. When I looked at the place on Google Maps after, it was rated a lowly 3.9 starts. No way would it have made it through my personal filter if I found the place through the application. [my personal filter would have remvoed my glance]</p>

<p>I let this chance encounter guide my attitude toward the rest of trip.</p>

<p>The following days, I would walk until I got hungry. Then, I would come across a food truck, a hole in the wall, or a nice restaurant to refuel at.</p>

<p>Safe to say, this was a freeing feeling. I was never in a hurry. I didn’t have an itinerary. At most, my checklist was one item long. Wednesday was dedicated to Central Park. Thursday was dedicated to exploring around and inside the New York Public Library. On my way to the library, I discovered the Empire State building, like Columbus discovered America. [What a pleasant surprise.]</p>

<p>Upon returning to Calgary, I didn’t feel like I needed a vacation from my vacation. I was happy with the pace of my trip, because I let go of the idea that a trip to a new city should be stressful and planned to the minute.</p>

<p>You might share a similar opinion of travel. But if you don’t, let me introduce you to the idea of travel as a creative act.</p>

<p>Travel, in my opinion, should be improvised, spontaneous, and instinctual.  When you’re exploring a city, let your senses lead the way.</p>

<p>Eat where you smelt the bakery. Your nose will not let you down.
Catch a glimpse of green, and walk to the park. Have a picnic.
Stay for a few hours at free concert you heard a few blocks away. It is also a great place to strike up a conversation.</p>

<p><strong>Or just sit and listen to your surroundings.</strong></p>

<div class="text-center mb-5" id="sounds-text" style="color:#0871AF;font-size:20px;">Play</div>

<p>By avoiding someone else’s curated guide, you start to create your own relationship with the city.</p>

<p>Discovering your own taste, as you would with music, movies, or art. Or even people.</p>

<p>Going to a new city is like going to a first date.</p>

<p>Typically, you don’t know much about the person you are seeing. That’s the reason for your excitement. You are simply showing up at a specified time with no expectations. You can look at their online profiles for as long as you want, but you will never know how you will feel until you start talking face-to-face.</p>

<p>Of course, you might have a few questions planned, but I think a date is better than an interrogation.</p>

<p>You can’t plan how you feel during the first date, and it’s the same when you arrive to a new city.</p>

<p>Compare arriving to a new city to going on a first date.</p>

<p>Condensing a city into a checklist removes most of the spontaneity that a city affords. New York isn’t just the Empire State Building, and the Statue of Liberty. Paris isn’t the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre.</p>

<p>In fact, how</p>

<p>Research them</p>

<p>You might have a few questions planned, but you’re going in there blind.</p>

<p>But isn’t it much more interesting to discover a person without having any prior knowledge of them? Besides</p>

<p>Wouldn’t it be great to be surpsied to see the Eiffel Tower in Paris?
Or</p>

<p>It would be like discovering a song.</p>

<p>Go to Paris, and become surprised to see the Eiffel Tower.</p>

<p>A detailed itinerary is a prelude to stress. Cities welcome serendipity.</p>

<p>We travel to feel like kids again. And what don’t kids have? Plans.</p>

<p>Exploring.</p>

<p>That’s not to say</p>

<p>Instead of predicting what you will want in six months before your trip, all you ask yourself is
<em>What do I feel like doing today?</em></p>

<p>Travel is Creative. An art. Let the city come to you, walk.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Improvisation</li>
  <li>Eiffel tower</li>
  <li>An example, metaphor</li>
  <li>condensing a city into a checklist</li>
  <li>exploring like a kid, its novelty</li>
  <li>An okay with uncertainty</li>
  <li>Developing taste</li>
  <li>Relationship with a city</li>
  <li>Follow your nose, follow your senses</li>
  <li>mo</li>
  <li>Less exhausting</li>
  <li>Historical travel is different as well</li>
  <li>Ask a human, not Google.</li>
  <li>A great conversation starter is ‘a place to eat around’</li>
  <li>Checklists are killer, exhausting</li>
  <li>Google stars</li>
  <li>Doing what you are feeling that day, not three months ago</li>
  <li>Finding unusual things becomes</li>
  <li>research vs planning</li>
  <li>budget</li>
  <li>Don’t know the city until you are there</li>
  <li>this is city focused</li>
</ul>

<p>When you are at home, checklists control your day, filled with personal errands to business meetings.</p>

<p>Why do you travel?</p>

<p>If the goal is</p>

<p>If the goal of yout vacation was to remove yourself from the rigidity of an ordinary day, why would you make checklists again? Travel gives you the freedom to remove yourself from a schedule.</p>

<p>And if you are on vacation, travelling, you have the freedom to get rid of them.</p>

<p>Why did you go on vacation in the first place? Maybe it was to remove yourself from the rigidity of a typical day.</p>

<p>If you like a place and want to return to it, do it.</p>

<p>And most of the time, the to-do list item ends up carrying over to the next day.</p>

<p>And if you haven’t</p>

<p>By removing yourself from plans, you are letting your senses guide you instead. [why is this important].</p>

<p>Removing yourself from rigidity allows you
A city is not a to-do list.</p>
